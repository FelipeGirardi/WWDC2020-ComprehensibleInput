# Comprehensible Input
### Don't learn a language, acquire it.
 ___

 **Comprehensible input**, [proposed by linguist Stephen Krashen in the 1980s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiTsduRreug), is an interesting new approach to studying a foreign language, suitable for all ages. This playground will show you how it works in a clean and minimalistic way.
 
 Imagine you're reading a book, watching a movie or checking a restaurant menu, and you stumble upon a sentence in a language you're not familiar with. What do you do? Do you get hesitant and confused? Or do you try to figure out the context piece by piece, or better yet, *word by word*?
 
 If you can't understand everything, it's okay, that's not the point here. What matters most is naturally acquiring the meaning of words using some form of *input*. When the input allows you to *comprehend* new words, we have **comprehensible input**.
 
 \
 But you might be wondering, how to "naturally acquire" the meaning of words? One of the best ways to do so is by using visual input: for example, the use of colors and simple images (like emojis) is great because it's easy to associate them with words. Let's try it out!

 We'll be using Spanish as the foreign language in this playground, as it is the most commonly taught second language in the USA. Here are the step-by-step instructions:
 
 &nbsp;

 1. **Disable** the option "Enable Results" for better performance.
 2. **Run the code** and you'll see a sentence in Spanish.
 3. **Tap on any word** to hear its pronunciation. Colored words, when tapped, will show a related image that will help you guess their meaning.
 4. **Press the button "Word by word"** to see the translation of every word and check if you guessed the sentence' meaning correctly. (Hopefully yes!)
 
 &nbsp;

 When you're ready, press **Next** to continue.
