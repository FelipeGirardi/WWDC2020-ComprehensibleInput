## One last challenge!

Here's the last sentence of this playground, and the most challenging. Can you figure out what it means? It contains an important message...

As you could see, Comprehensible Input can be really helpful in the process of learning a language. It's very easy to find different forms of input: they can be in the form of foreign movies, TV series, videos, and many others. Combining language lessons with Comprehensible Input can be very powerful - you might be able to learn a language faster than you ever thought you could, and have fun along the way!
