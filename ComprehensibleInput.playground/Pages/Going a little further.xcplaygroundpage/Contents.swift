 ## Let's go a little further.
 ---
 
 \
 Based on what you've seen in the first page, you should be able to "get" the meaning of a few Spanish words, even with no previous knowledge of the language. What if we used that to learn even more words, in a sort of *cascade effect*?
 
 We'll follow the same format as the first page, but with a slightly more complex sentence. Your goal is the same, just follow the steps below:
 
 &nbsp;
 
 1. Run the code
 2. Tap on the words
 3. Observe the images
 4. Make connections in your mind
 5. Try to guess what the sentence means
 6. When you think you got it, check by pressing "Word by word"

 &nbsp;
 
 - Note: A useful tip: many Spanish words are written in a similar way to English. This could also help you infer their meaning! It's a very common practice in language learning.
 
 &nbsp;
 
 Afterwards, press **Next** to continue.
